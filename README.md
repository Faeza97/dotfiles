# ‚öôÔ∏è Helder's Dotfiles

My base settings for when I start in a new environment.

## Requirements

Set zsh as your default shell:

```bash
sudo chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

## Setting up your Mac

- Update macOS to the latest version with the App Store;
- Install Xcode from the App Store, open it and accept the license agreement;

## Install

- Clone onto your machine:

```bash
git clone git://github.com/helderburato/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

- Install the dotfiles:

sh ~/.dotfiles/install.sh
```

Restart your computer and enjoy your new configuration.! ‚úåüèª

## Generate the SSH Keys

It's required to generate in every machine you start.

- Go to your $HOME with `cd ~`;
- Generate the new key `ssh-keygen`;

## Troubleshoot

- If you get any problems with `antigen`, try `rm -rf ~/.antigen` after complete, close your terminal and open again to reinstall the packages from antigen.
